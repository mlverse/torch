Neural networks can be constructed using the `nn` functionality.

Now that you had a glimpse of `autograd`, `nn` depends on `autograd` to define models and differentiate them. An nn.Module contains layers, and a method `forward(input)` that returns the output.

For example, look at this network that classifies digit images:

![Convnet for mnist classification](assets/mnist.png)

It is a simple feed-forward network. It takes the input, feeds it through several layers one after the other, and then finally gives the output.

A typical training procedure for a neural network is as follows:

- Define the neural network that has some learnable parameters (or weights)
- Iterate over a dataset of inputs
- Process input through the network
- Compute the loss (how far is the output from being correct)
- Propagate gradients back into the network’s parameters
- Update the weights of the network, typically using a simple update rule: `weight = weight - learning_rate * gradient`.

## Define the network

Let's define this network:

```{r}
Net <- nn_module(
  initialize = function() {
    self$conv1 = nn_conv2d(1, 6, 3)
    self$conv2 = nn_conv2d(6, 16, 3)
    # an affine operation: y = Wx + b
    self$fc1 = nn_linear(16 * 6 * 6, 120)  # 6*6 from image dimension
    self$fc2 = nn_linear(120, 84)
    self$fc3 = nn_linear(84, 10)
  },
  forward = function(x) {
    x %>% 
      
      self$conv1() %>% 
      nnf_relu() %>% 
      nnf_max_pool2d(c(2,2)) %>% 
      
      self$conv2() %>% 
      nnf_relu() %>% 
      nnf_max_pool2d(c(2,2)) %>% 
      
      torch_flatten(start_dim = 2) %>% 
      
      self$fc1() %>% 
      nnf_relu() %>% 
      
      self$fc2() %>% 
      nnf_relu() %>% 
      
      self$fc3()
  }
)

net <- Net()
```

You just have to define the `forward` function, and the `backward` function (where gradients are computed) is automatically defined for you using `autograd.` You can use any of the Tensor operations in the `forward` function.

The learnable parameters of a model are returned by `net$parameters`.

```{r}
str(net$parameters)
```

Let’s try a random 32x32 input. Note: expected input size of this net (LeNet) is 32x32. To use this net on the MNIST dataset, please resize the images from the dataset to 32x32.

```{r}
input <- torch_randn(1, 1, 32, 32)
out <- net(input)
out
```

Zero the gradient buffers of all parameters and backprops with random gradients:

```{r}
net$zero_grad()
out$backward(torch_randn(1, 10))
```

> **Note**: `nn` only supports mini-batches. The entire torch.nn package only supports inputs that are a mini-batch of samples, and not a single sample. For example, `nn_conv2d` will take in a 4D Tensor of nSamples x nChannels x Height x Width.
If you have a single sample, just use `input$unsqueeze(1)` to add a fake batch dimension.

Before proceeding further, let’s recap all the classes you’ve seen so far.

### Recap

- `torch_tensor` - A multi-dimensional array with support for autograd operations like `backward()`. Also holds the gradient w.r.t. the tensor.

- `nn_module` - Neural network module. Convenient way of encapsulating parameters, with helpers for moving them to GPU, exporting, loading, etc.

- `nn_parameter` - A kind of Tensor, that is automatically registered as a parameter when assigned as an attribute to a Module.

- `autograd_function` - Implements forward and backward definitions of an autograd operation. Every Tensor operation creates at least a single Function node that connects to functions that created a Tensor and encodes its history.

### At this point, we covered

- Defining a neural network
- Processing inputs and calling backward

### Still left

- Computing the loss
- Updating the weights of the network

## Loss function

A loss function takes the (output, target) pair of inputs, and computes a value that estimates how far away the output is from the target.

There are several different loss functions under the nn package . A simple loss is: `nnf_mse_loss` which computes the mean-squared error between the input and the target.

For example:

```{r}
output <- net(input)
target <- torch_randn(10)  # a dummy target, for example
target <- target$view(c(1, -1))  # make it the same shape as output

loss <- nnf_mse_loss(output, target)
loss
```

Now, if you follow loss in the backward direction, using its `$grad_fn` attribute, you will see a graph of computations that looks like this:

```
input -> conv2d -> relu -> maxpool2d -> conv2d -> relu -> maxpool2d
      -> view -> linear -> relu -> linear -> relu -> linear
      -> MSELoss
      -> loss
```

So, when we call `loss$backward()`, the whole graph is differentiated w.r.t. the loss, and all Tensors in the graph that has requires_grad=True will have their `#grad` Tensor accumulated with the gradient.

For illustration, let us follow a few steps backward:

```{r}
loss$grad_fn
loss$grad_fn$next_functions[[1]]
loss$grad_fn$next_functions[[1]]$next_functions[[1]]
```

## Backprop

To backpropagate the error all we have to do is to `loss$backward()`. You need to clear the existing gradients though, else gradients will be accumulated to existing gradients.

Now we shall call `loss$backward()`, and have a look at conv1’s bias gradients before and after the backward.

```{r}
net$zero_grad()     # zeroes the gradient buffers of all parameters

# conv1.bias.grad before backward
net$conv1$bias$grad

loss$backward()

# conv1.bias.grad after backward
net$conv1$bias$grad
```

Now, we have seen how to use loss functions.

## Update the weights

The simplest update rule used in practice is the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD):

$$weight = weight - learning_rate * gradient$$ 

We can implement this using simple R code:

```{r}
learning_rate <- 0.01
for (f in net$parameters) {
  with_no_grad({
    f$sub_(f$grad * learning_rate)
  })
}
```

> **Note:** Weight updates here is wraped around `with_no_grad` as we don't the updates to be tracked by the autograd engine. 

However, as you use neural networks, you want to use various different update rules such as SGD, Nesterov-SGD, Adam, RMSProp, etc. 

```{r}
# create your optimizer
optimizer <- optim_sgd(net$parameters, lr = 0.01)

# in your training loop:
optimizer$zero_grad()   # zero the gradient buffers
output <- net(input)
loss <- nnf_mse_loss(output, target)
loss$backward()
optimizer$step()    # Does the update
```

> **Note:** Observe how gradient buffers had to be manually set to zero using `optimizer$zero_grad()`. This is because gradients are accumulated as explained in the Backprop section.
