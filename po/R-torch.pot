msgid "Because this function allows access to unexported functions, please use with caution, and\n            only if you are sure know what you are doing. Unexported functions will expect inputs that\n            are more C++-like than R-like. For example, they will expect all indexes to be 0-based instead\n            of 1-based. In addition unexported functions may be subject to removal from the API without\n            warning. Set quiet = TRUE to silence this warning."
