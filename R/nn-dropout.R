#' Dropout module
#'
#' During training, randomly zeroes some of the elements of the input
#' tensor with probability `p` using samples from a Bernoulli
#' distribution. Each channel will be zeroed out independently on every forward
#' call.
#'
#' This has proven to be an effective technique for regularization and
#' preventing the co-adaptation of neurons as described in the paper
#' [Improving neural networks by preventing co-adaptation of feature
#' detectors](https://arxiv.org/abs/1207.0580).
#'
#' Furthermore, the outputs are scaled by a factor of :math:`\frac{1}{1-p}` during
#' training. This means that during evaluation the module simply computes an
#' identity function.
#'
#' @param p probability of an element to be zeroed. Default: 0.5
#' @param inplace If set to `TRUE`, will do this operation in-place. Default: `FALSE`.

#' - Input: \eqn{(*)}. Input can be of any shape
#' - Output: \eqn{(*)}. Output is of the same shape as input

#' Dropout2D module
#'
#' Randomly zero out entire channels (a channel is a 2D feature map,
#' e.g., the \eqn{j}-th channel of the \eqn{i}-th sample in the
#' batched input is a 2D tensor \eqn{\mbox{input}[i, j]}).
#'
#' Each channel will be zeroed out independently on every forward call with
#' probability `p` using samples from a Bernoulli distribution.
#' Usually the input comes from [nn_conv2d] modules.
#'
#' As described in the paper
#' [Efficient Object Localization Using Convolutional Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.4280) ,
#' if adjacent pixels within feature maps are strongly correlated
#' (as is normally the case in early convolution layers) then i.i.d. dropout
#' will not regularize the activations and will otherwise just result
#' in an effective learning rate decrease.
#' In this case, [nn_dropout2d] will help promote independence between
#' feature maps and should be used instead.
