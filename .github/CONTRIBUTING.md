# Contributing to torch

Many thanks for wanting to contribute to `torch`! We welcome all kinds
of contributions, from correcting typos via bug fixes to feature
additions.

## Fixing typos

To fix typos, spelling mistakes, or grammatical errors, you need to make
changes in the *source* `.R` file in question, not in the generated
`.Rd` file. Thereafter, run `tools/document.R` to regenerate the
documentation. (See [Workflow] below for why.)

## Filing bugs

If you find a bug in `torch`, please open an issue
[here](https://github.com/mlverse/torch/issues). Please provide detailed
information on how to reproduce the bug. It would be great to also
provide a [`reprex`](https://reprex.tidyverse.org/).

## Feature requests

Feel free to open issues
[here](https://github.com/mlverse/torch/issues), and add the
`feature-request` tag. Also try searching if there's already an open
issue for your `feature-request` -- in this case it's better to comment
or upvote it instead of opening a new one.

## Examples

We welcome contributed examples. Feel free to open a PR with new
examples. The examples should be placed in the `vignettes/examples`
folder.

The examples should consist of an `.R` file and an `.Rmd` with the same
name that just renders the code.

See
[basic-nn-module.R](https://github.com/mlverse/torch/blob/master/vignettes/examples/basic-nn-module.R)
and
[basic-nn-module.Rmd](https://github.com/mlverse/torch/blob/master/vignettes/examples/basic-nn-module.Rmd)
for an example.

It's important that one can run the example without manually downloading
any dataset/file. You should also add an entry to the [`_pkgdown.yaml`
file](https://github.com/mlverse/torch/blob/master/_pkgdown.yml#L24-L25)
for your example.

## Translations

We welcome translations. This consist in providing a translation file of all the package messages in a local language to help new users of {torch}.  
One simple way to proceed is to use the help of {potool} package to 
1. create your choosen language translation file - let's say Spanish which code is `sp` - `potools::po_create(dir = ".", languages = "sp")`. 
2. use a text editor to fulfill the translations in the newly created `po/R-sp.po` file.
The complete process is well explained in the potool [vignette for translators](https://michaelchirico.github.io/potools/articles/translators.html)

## Code contributions

We have many open issues in the [github
repo](https://github.com/mlverse/torch/issues). If there's one item that
you want to work on, you can comment on it and ask for directions.

### Code style

-   New R code should follow the [`tidyverse` style
    guide](https://style.tidyverse.org). You can use the
    [styler](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=styler) package to apply
    these styles, or simply run the `tools/style.sh` script, which also
    formats the code and removes whitespace. Please don't re-style code
    that has nothing to do with your PR.

-   New C/C++ code should follow the [`Google` style
    guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html). You can
    use [`clang-format`](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html)
    to apply these styles, or simply run `tools/style.sh`, which also
    formats the code and removes whitespace. Please don't re-style code
    that has nothing to do with your PR.

-   We use [roxygen2](https://cran.r-project.org/package=roxygen2), with
    [Markdown
    syntax](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/vignettes/rd-formatting.html),
    to build all documentation for the package.

-   We use [testthat](https://cran.r-project.org/package=testthat) for
    unit tests. Contributions with test cases included are easier to
    accept.

### Requirements

-   R installation
-   R Tools for compilation (only on Windows)
-   The `devtools` package
-   CMake to compile `lantern` binaries

### Workflow

We use `devtools` as the toolchain for development, but a few steps must
be done before upfront.

The first time you clone the repository, run:

``` r
source("tools/buildlantern.R")
```

This will first download LibTorch and copy its binaries to the `deps`
folder in the working directory, and then, compile the `lantern`
binaries themselves.

This command must be run everytime you modify `lantern` code, i.e., code
that lives in `lantern/src`.

You can then run

``` r
devtools::load_all()
```

to load `torch`, and test interactively. Alternatively, run

``` r
devtools::test()
```

to execute the test suite.

Finally, it's important to update the documentation. Please always use
the custom `tools/document.R` script instead of `devtools::document()`,
as we need to patch `roxygen2` to avoid running the examples on CRAN.

We're looking forward to your contributions!
