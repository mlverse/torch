# torch <a href='https://torch.mlverse.org'><img src='man/figures/torch.png' align="right" height="139" /></a>

[![Lifecycle: experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-experimental-orange.svg)](https://www.tidyverse.org/lifecycle/#experimental)
![R build status](https://github.com/mlverse/torch/workflows/Test/badge.svg)
[![CRAN status](https://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/torch)](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=torch)
[![](https://cranlogs.r-pkg.org/badges/torch)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=torch)

## Installation

torch can be installed from CRAN with:

```r
install.packages("torch")
```

You can also install the development version with:

```r
remotes::install_github("mlverse/torch")
```

At the first package load additional software will be 
installed.

## Examples

You can create torch tensors from R objects with the `torch_tensor` function and convert them back to R objects with `as_array`.

```{r}
library(torch)
x <- array(runif(8), dim = c(2, 2, 2))
y <- torch_tensor(x, dtype = torch_float64())
y
identical(x, as_array(y))
```

### Simple Autograd Example

In the following snippet we let torch, using the autograd feature, calculate the derivatives:

```{r}
x <- torch_tensor(1, requires_grad = TRUE)
w <- torch_tensor(2, requires_grad = TRUE)
b <- torch_tensor(3, requires_grad = TRUE)
y <- w * x + b
y$backward()
x$grad
w$grad
b$grad
```

## Contributing

No matter your current skills it's possible to contribute to `torch` development.
