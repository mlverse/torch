\section{triu(input, diagonal=0, out=NULL) -> Tensor }{


Returns the upper triangular part of a matrix (2-D tensor) or batch of matrices
\code{input}, the other elements of the result tensor \code{out} are set to 0.

The upper triangular part of the matrix is defined as the elements on and
above the diagonal.

The argument \code{diagonal} controls which diagonal to consider. If
\code{diagonal} = 0, all elements on and above the main diagonal are
retained. A positive value excludes just as many diagonals above the main
diagonal, and similarly a negative value includes just as many diagonals below
the main diagonal. The main diagonal are the set of indices
\eqn{\lbrace (i, i) \rbrace} for \eqn{i \in [0, \min\{d_{1}, d_{2}\} - 1]} where
\eqn{d_{1}, d_{2}} are the dimensions of the matrix.
