\title{Trace a module}
\usage{
jit_trace_module(mod, ..., strict = TRUE, respect_mode = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{mod}{A torch \code{nn_module()}  containing methods whose names are specified
in inputs. The given methods will be compiled as a part of a single ScriptModule.}

\item{...}{A named list containing sample inputs indexed by method names
in mod. The inputs will be passed to methods whose names correspond to inputs
keys while tracing. \code{list('forward'=example_forward_input, 'method2'=example_method2_input)}.}

\item{strict}{run the tracer in a strict mode or not (default: \code{TRUE}). Only
turn this off when you want the tracer to record your mutable container types
(currently list/dict) and you are sure that the container you are using in
your problem is a constant structure and does not get used as control flow
(\code{if}, \code{for}) conditions.}

\item{respect_mode}{(\code{logical(1)})\cr
Whether the forward method of the resulting module should respect the mode ('train' or 'eval').
If \code{TRUE} (default), both passes will be jitted and be available as methods \code{trainforward} and \code{evalforward}.
The \code{forward} method will then select the appropriate method based on the mode of the module.
If \code{FALSE}, only the current mode of the module will be jitted.}
}
\description{
Trace a module and return an executable ScriptModule that will be optimized
using just-in-time compilation. When a module is passed to \code{\link[=jit_trace]{jit_trace()}}, only
the forward method is run and traced. With \code{\link[=jit_trace_module]{jit_trace_module()}}, you can specify
a named list of method names to example inputs to trace (see the inputs)
argument below.
